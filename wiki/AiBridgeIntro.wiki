 import com.google.devtools.simple.runtime.components.HandlesEventDispatching;
import com.google.devtools.simple.runtime.components.android.Form;
import com.google.devtools.simple.runtime.components.android.Label;

public class HelloWorldActivity extends Form implements HandlesEventDispatching {
    void $define() {
        new Label(this,"Hello World!");
    }
}
</code>
