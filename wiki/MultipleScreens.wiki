= Bridge Example - How to switch between screens =

An example to demos how to switch between screens using AiBridge and how it differs with using Android SDK

== Using AiBridge ==
When your app has multiple screens (activities), using AiBridge, you can switch between screens as shown below. 

_*NOTE 1:*_ You must declare all your activities in androidmanifest.xml

_*NOTE 2:*_ All your activities must exist in the same package

<code>
//switch to another activity without passing any parameters
startNewForm("MyOtherActivity");

//switch to another activity when you want to pass parameter
startNewForm("MyOtherActivity", "someParam");
</code>

== Using Android SDK ==
Code below shows how to use Android SDK to switch between screens:

<code>
//Switch to another activity without passing any parameter
Intent intent = new Intent(this, MyOtherActivity.class);
intent.putExtra("VALUE1", "value for MyOtherActivity");
intent.putExtra("VALUE2", "value for MyOtherActivity");

//Launches the activity for which you would like a result when it finished. 
//When this activity exits, your onActivityResult() method will be called with the given REQUEST_CODE. 

startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE); 

</code>
