1. YailList (basically an ArrayList) can now be sorted in unsorted or sorted order. This is useful when you when you want to display sorted items in a ListPicker; e.g.
<code>
   //create a string array for test purpose
   String[] items = new String[]{"b", "c", "a"};

   // create un-sorted list
   YailList yailListUnsorted= YailList.makeList(items);

   // create sorted list
   YailList yailListSorted= YailList.makeList(items, true);

   //now, add the items to a ListPicker 
   myListPickerElements(yailListSorted);

   //display results in notifier
   notifier.ShowMessageDialog("Unsorted\n"+yailListUnsorted+"\n\nSorted\n"+yailListSorted, "unsorted vs sorted", "Okay");
</code> 

2. You can now control the screen to stay ON or OFF for your app
<code>. This feature will useful for GPS / Map apps and when you like to keep the screen ON
   //keep screen on while this application is running
   setKeepScreenOn(true);
